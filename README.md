### Instruction for transfer tokens between Ethereum and Polygon
After our contracts are linked in mapper, we can move tokens from Ethereum to Polygon and back.  
```Attention!``` Only one of the managers appointed by the owner can produce mint of the ERC721Mint contract,  
so you must first add the desired address to the managers.

#### Deposit
1. Approve token id from ERC721Mint to the address ERC721PredicateProxy (```0xE6F45376f64e1F568BD1404C155e5fFD2F80F7AD```)
2. Go to the RootChainManagerProxy and execute depositFor (```0x7CfA0f105a4922E89666D7D63689d9C9b1eA7a19```)  

* user (address) - the address of the user to whom the token will be transferred (specify your own)  
* rootToken (address) - address ERC721Mint  
* depositData (bytes) - encoded abi tokenid  

#### Withdraw
1. we specify the necessary token addresses in config.js:  

* parent erc721 (ERC721Mint): ```0x<mainnet_contract_address> ```  
* child erc721 (Polygon_ERC721Mint): ```0x<polygon_contract_address>```  

2. Withdrawal process:  

* Open withdraw_start.js, change the tokenId to the token id (for example, ‘5’), execute the script, copy the txHash  
* Waiting for the checkpoint (~15 minutes)  
* Opening withdraw_exit.js, substitute txHash in isCheckPointed() and withdrawExit(), execute the script
