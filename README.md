### Instruction for transfer tokens between Ethereum and Polygon
After our contracts are linked in mapper, we can move tokens from Ethereum to Polygon and back.  
```Attention!``` Only one of the managers appointed by the owner can produce mint of the ERC721Mint contract,  
so you must first add the desired address to the managers.

#### How to edit env
1. You have to copy the fields of env.example to .env 
2. Let's analyze each field:  

* PRIVATE_KEY: the private key of your wallet  
* SCAN_API_KEY: API key created from your ethereum account dashboard  
* SCAN_API_KEY_POLYGON: API key created from your polygon account dashboard  
* RPC_NODE_URL_RINKEBY: link to the rpc_node of the rinkeby network  
* RPC_NODE_URL_MAINNET: link to the rpc_node of the mainnet network  
* RPC_NODE_URL_GOERLI: link to the rpc_node of the goerli network  
* RPC_NODE_URL_MUMBAI: link to the rpc_node of the mumbai network  
* RPC_NODE_URL_POLYGON: link to the rpc_node of the polygon network  
* ERC721MINT_NAME: desired erc721 token name  
* ERC721MINT_SYMBOL: desired symbol of the token  
* ERC721MINT_URI: link to the URI of your token  
* ETHEREUM_ERC721: the address of your erc721 token in ethereum network  
* POLYGON_ERC721: the address of your erc721 token in polygon network  
* USER1_FROM: the address of your wallet  

3. Fill in the empty fields  

#### How config.js and utils.js work
```utils.js``` - script exports functionality to connect to the matic network

You can change parameters into *getPOSClient* for testing needs, for example:

```const getPOSClient = (network = 'testnet', version = 'mumbai')```

```config.js``` - exports variables for .env file:

* pos.parent.erc721 and pos.child.erc721 - smart contract addresses for ethereum and matic networks
* user address and private key
* backend service and proof api links
* rpc node urls

All raw addresses are default.

#### Deposit (or how to transfer tokens from Ethereum to Polygon)
1. Approve token id from ERC721Mint to the address ERC721PredicateProxy (```0xE6F45376f64e1F568BD1404C155e5fFD2F80F7AD```)
2. Go to the RootChainManagerProxy and execute depositFor (```0x7CfA0f105a4922E89666D7D63689d9C9b1eA7a19```)  

* user (address) - the address of the user to whom the token will be transferred (specify your own)  
* rootToken (address) - address ERC721Mint  
* depositData (bytes) - encoded abi tokenid  

#### Withdraw (or how to transfer tokens from Polygon to Ethereum)
1. We specify the necessary token addresses in .env:  

* parent erc721 (ERC721Mint): ```ETHEREUM_ERC721```  
* child erc721 (Polygon_ERC721Mint): ```POLYGON_ERC721```  
* sender's address: ```USER1_FROM```

2. Withdrawal process:  

* Open withdraw_start.js, change the tokenId to the token id hash (for example, for token id = 5, token id hash will be equal to  ‘0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000005’), 
execute the script, copy the txHash  
* Waiting for the checkpoint (~15 minutes)  
* Opening withdraw_exit.js, substitute txHash in withdrawStartTxHash, execute the script
